## Prefácio

This book is primarily addressed to students who are taking a course on the C++ language, to those who wish to self-study the C++ language, as well as to programmers who have experience with C and want to move on to C++. It could also prove useful to instructors of the C++ course, who are looking for explanatory programming examples to add in their lectures.

This book aims to introduce the reader to the basic principles of C++ and the philosophy of object-oriented programming. It does not present all the technical and syntax details of the language, but tries to present the fundamental concepts of the language in a simple and understandable way. So, this book is not a reference book; its goal is to make the reader understand how to use a feature and not to describe every syntax or technical detail of the feature. Understanding the technical details comes with time and practice. After all, you don’t have to know all the details of C++ to write C++ programs.

Also, this book does not present in detail the services of the Standard Template Library (STL). It just provides an overview of its most important features. A detailed presentation of STL would require an entire book. However, because learning STL is an integral part of learning C++, you should, after reading this book, read an STL reference book in order to get familiar with the numerous useful services and tools that STL offers.

So what, exactly, differentiates this book from the others in the field? This book tests the skills of the reader by providing a solid introduction to the C++ theory enriched with tips and advice accompanied by a large number of difficulty-scaled examples and solved programming exercises showing how concepts can materialize in code. When I first encountered the C++ language as a student, I needed a book that would introduce me to in a smooth way to the fundamentals of the C++ language, to provide a robust foundational understanding of its principles, a book with a focus on providing inside information and programming knowledge through practical examples and meaningful advice. That is the spirit that this book aims to capture.
